This act is designed to protect the creators of content from having their work illegally copied. It makes it illegal to use, copy or distribute commercially available software without buying the appropirate license. 
				
If you buy a piece of media, it is illegal to:
<ul>
    <li>pass a copy to a friend.</li>
    <li>make a copy and then sell it.</li>
    <li>use the software on a network, unless the license allows it.</li>
</ul>
The software industry can take some steps to prevent illegal copying of software:
<ul>
    <li>requiring a unique key before installation.</li>
    <li>requiring the presence of a CD.</li>
    <li>requiring the presence of a dongle.</li>
</ul>
It is worth noting that while you can protect games, applications or operating systems, algorithms themselves are not eligible for protection.
